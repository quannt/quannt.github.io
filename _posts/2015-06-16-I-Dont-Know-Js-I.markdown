**JavaScript**! Where do I even begin? I like to think that I have a love hate relationship with this language. It all started 3 years ago during my first job. I was fresh out of school, innocent with a dream of being the best developer in the world. There was just this slightly tiny problem : **JavaScript**. And not just plain **JavaScript**, it was **jQuery** . My first few assignments on the job involved working on an existing ASP.NET portal with a lot of front-end interactions by **jQuery**. Of course young me didn't know  crap about **jQuery** let alone fundamental **JavaScript**. 

It got to a point that it took me so long to do a simple stuff like populating, reading values from a HTML form that I started to hate this **JavaScript**/**jQuery** thing. Gosh why does it have to be so difficult, why CAN"T I DO EVERYTHING IN .NET. F*CK YOU JAVASCRIPT and your functional whatever scope programming. I hated **JavaScript** so much that I decided I may as well be good at it.

Fast forward ahead, I started to get comfortable with the language. I started to feel the need to understand **JavaScript** more. I feel my **Javascript slash jQuery** code is becoming a burden ( read spaghetti ). It was also at this point that I was introduced to this book [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) during one of my Uni course. Hmm so there was this thing called Functional Programming and it looks beautiful. I started to develop more interest in Functional Programming in general and JavaScript in particular. I read MDN. I tried CodeSchool. I read books.

Fast forward until now, I am much more confident in my **JavaScript**. Relatively speaking my JavaScript is still pretty mediocre and I still have much more to learn, especially with ES6, Web Component and all that stuffs being rolled out . But compared to young me 3 years ago, this is so much different, this feels so great. *I actually can say JavaScript is my favorite language now*. I can now confidently build a full fledged Single Page Application using JavaScript (with help from jQuery). 

Next part, I will be sharing about the books, articles, resources that helped me get comfortable with JavaScript. Hope it's gonna be helpful.

So.. that's it for today. Thank you for reading and until next time!
