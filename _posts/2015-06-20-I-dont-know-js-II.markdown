As promosied from [last post](http://quannt.github.io/general/2015/06/16/I-Dont-Know-Js-I.html), here are some useful resources to learn JavaScript that I have personally used over the years. Disclaimers : These are suggestions and I am not by all mean an expert in JavaScript.


### If you want to start from scratch

Follow this [javascriptissexy article](http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/). You should spend 6 to 8 weeks working on books, online courses, assignments, try to finish as much as you can.

### You know the basics and want to improve your JS code
I would still recommend follow the javascriptissexy article. However, depending on your current knowledge, you need not follow all of them, pick the parts that you are not feeling comfortable with and work on it.


After getting the foundation of the language, read [this book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025245.do).

What you will learn and be able to do after reading this book


- Build your own coding style (if you don't have one yet) and hopefully stick with it.&nbsp;
- Separate layers. Why you should keep your CSS out of JS, JS out of CSS, JS out of HTML, HTML out of JS and how to do so.&nbsp;
- Common gotchas when building a script-heavy application.&nbsp;



The second book is another excellent one, [ Learning JavaScript Design Patterns
A JavaScript and jQuery Developer's Guide
By Addy Osmani](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/)

![Learning JavaScript Design Patterns](http://akamaicovers.oreilly.com/images/0636920025832/lrg.jpg)

The key takeaway after reading this is it not JS or jQuery fault if your code is a mess, it's your fault. You can and should apply design pattern when coding. If you don't have time for the whole book, take a look at [the module pattern chapter](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#modulepatternjavascript)

### Final Words
I hope you find something useful in this article and until next time. Bye bye!
