Over the past few years, I have come across numerous resources to learn `JavaScript`. Here I attempt to list the resources that I have tried and put some comments. Hopefully this would be helpful.


### Noob Level
---
* [Book: JavaScript For Cats](http://jsforcats.com/) is pretty good place to start. It's a quick read to get you familiar with basic `JavaScript` syntax. Don't expect more than that. If you are already familiar with `JavaScript` syntax, feel free to skip this.
* Alternatives: [Online Course: Code School's JS course](http://javascript-roadtrip.codeschool.com/), [Online Course: Code Academy's Getting Started With Programming Course](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/getting-started-v2/0/1)

### Newbie Level
---
* [Book: Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/). 
* [Book: You Don't Know JS series by Kyle Simpson](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)

Do not force yourself to understand everything from these books at your very first try. It's not easy to be able to digest all the crap about `this`, `scope`,`closure`, etc. I know I don't. The point here to is to keep going. If you can't understand a tricky part, fine, take a note on that and move on. After sometimes you must go back and revise it again. 

* Alternavtive : [Book: SpeakingJS](http://speakingjs.com/es5/index.html)


### Intermediate
---
At this point you are already pretty good. I can go as wild as saying that you are already more competence than half of the web developers out there who can only glue libraries like `jQUery`, `bootstrap` together. Go and apply for a junior developer position. You will learn way more than any books or online courses can possibly teach you. 

Some useful resources at this point

* [Book: Maintainable JavaScript](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025245.do). Great book on how to write good, production ready `JavaScript`. Some things you should expect to learn from this
- Build your own coding style and why it's so important to have one.&nbsp;
- Separation of concerns and how to apply it on web development environment&nbsp;
- Common gotchas when building a script-heavy application.&nbsp;


* [Book: Learning JavaScript Design Patterns A JavaScript and jQuery Developer's Guide By Addy Osmani](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/). Wikipedia does a pretty good job at explaining what is design pattern

> In software engineering, a design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design

If you don't have time for the whole book, take a look at [the module pattern chapter](http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#modulepatternjavascript)

* [Book: Developing Backbone.js Applications](http://addyosmani.github.io/backbone-fundamentals/) `Backbone.js` used to be one of the most popular framework. Read this even if you don't intend to use `Backbone.js` because you will be able to learn about MVC (one of the most used architecture in the web), what are the building blocks of a js framework and so many other things. 

* [Book: Exploring ES6](http://exploringjs.com/es6/) ES6/ES2015 is all the rage now and because we `JavaScript` developers like to live on the edge so...yeah. I have not read the book yet so I can't give any comment on this.
