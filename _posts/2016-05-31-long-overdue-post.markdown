It's been more than 4 months since my last blog post, way too long than I would like it to be. In my defense, I relocated back to Hanoi after around 7 years staying in Singapore (time does fly!), which is a big deal for me. I was busy spending my time adjusting my lifestyle, connecting back with old friends, etc.

I have heard someone said "All places are the same once you stay there long enough, only the css are different!". 

I don't know how true it is, guess time will tell but for now I kind of prefer Hanoi than Singapore. Not that I have anything against Singapore. It is probably just me allowing myself to have more fun here. 

Back then in Singapore, I was strict to myself, always put my job and study above everything else. I was living like a robot : eat - sleep - work - study - eat and eventually I got sick of that lifestyle.

I hope that I am not making the same mistake in Hanoi. This time will be different, I will remind myself to enjoy the ride more often. Because afterall, what's the point?
